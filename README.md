# iterator
Developed in Java 8 though doesn't use the Java 8 Lambdas or streaming. Should should be Java 1.6+ compatible.
 
# How to run the program
java -cp target/iterator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.azahmed.iterator.iterator.IteratorRunner

And enter the values when prompted. 

# Assumptions
The keyboard inputs entered are integers (didn't put any validations around them)
The rules are applied in the order that they are entered in the list.
If the first rule is satisfied, then the program skips the other rules for that number  

# Improvements
More data validations
Use Log4j for logging

# Running code locally
Its a mvn project, So download and import :)
